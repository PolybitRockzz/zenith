## About

This project is a proof of concept architecture of using AI models for market analysis and trading decisions. It is not meant to be used for real-world trading.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](./architecture.png)

This is a simple system architecture that uses Gemini as the trading API, NewsAPI.org for news, and a local LLM for research. This chart is made using Excalidraw.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Gemini API Key (get from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com))
- NewsAPI.org API Key (get from [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PolybitRockzz/zenith-ai-hedge-fund.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   cd zenith-ai-hedge-fund
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### How to Use

First, create directory named `data` in the root of the project.

Then, create a file named `companies.json` in the `data` directory, which is an empty JSON array for now. Also create a directory named `history` in the `data` directory. (This process will be automated in the future.)

After that, you can start the application by running `streamlit run app.py` in the root of the project.

There are 4 pages in the application:

- **Home**: This is the home page of the application. It is the first page that you will see when you open the application.
- **Market Analysis**: This is the page where you prompt the AI to analyze the market, and it will return a list of stocks that you can trade and the reasoning behind it.
- **Trading Decisions**: This is the page where you can view your previous trading decisions, and the AI's analysis of the market.
- **About**: This is the page where you can learn more about the application.
